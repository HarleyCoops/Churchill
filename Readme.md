## Identifying a True First Edition

A genuine first edition, first printing of Winston S. Churchill’s "The Second World War" (Cassell, UK) is distinguished by several key attributes that reflect its rarity and prestige. Collectors should look for the following hallmarks:

- Published by Cassell and Company Ltd., London, with black cloth boards and gilt spine titles.
- The top edge of the text block is red, though some fading may occur over time.
- Decorative endpapers are present, and the copyright page states only "First Published [year]" without mention of later printings.
- There are no book club, reprint, or export marks, and all folding maps and diagrams are included as called for.
- The dust jackets for Volumes I–IV are priced at "25s. NET," while Volumes V–VI are marked "30s. NET," all printed on uncoated matte paper without later price stickers or publisher imprints.
- Jackets are often prone to browning and wear, and original, unrestored examples are highly desirable.
- The correct price on the dust jacket is the most visible external sign of a first issue jacket.

These points together ensure the authenticity and collectability of this luxury edition.
