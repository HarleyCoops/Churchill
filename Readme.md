## Identifying a True First Edition

A genuine first edition, first printing of Winston S. Churchill’s "The Second World War" (Cassell, UK) is distinguished by several key attributes this set has:

- Published by Cassell and Company Ltd., London, with black cloth boards and gilt spine titles.
- The top edge of the text block is red, though some fading may occur over time.
- Decorative endpapers are present, and the copyright page states only "First Published [year]" without mention of later printings.
- There are no book club, reprint, or export marks, and all folding maps and diagrams are included as called for.
- The dust jackets for Volumes I–IV are priced at "25s. NET," while Volumes V–VI are marked "30s. NET," all printed on uncoated matte paper without later price stickers or publisher imprints.
- Jackets are often prone to browning and wear, that is expected. 
- The correct price on the dust jacket is the most visible external sign of a first issue jacket.

I have tried to find the original letter that Fairfax sent Churchill the one lead I had was a different Colonel Fairfax.

Colonel Bryan Charles Fairfax, C.M.G. (12 September 1873 – 29 January 1950), was a distinguished British Army officer whose career spanned the late Victorian era through the First World War. He initially served as Captain in the 3rd Battalion, King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry and later in the West India Regiment, and participated in the 1900 Boxer Uprising in China. During World War I, Fairfax commanded the Chinese Labour Corps in France, overseeing nearly 100,000 men, and subsequently led Canadian battalions, including the 199th Battalion (Duchess of Connaught's Own Irish Canadian Rangers), C.E.F., recruited in Toronto. He was awarded the Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (C.M.G.) in 1916 for his wartime service.

After the war, Fairfax held significant posts such as Director of Remounts at the War Office and stood as a Conservative candidate in the 1919 Spen Valley by-election. He retired in the 1920s and spent his later years at his estate, Whitwell Hall in Yorkshire, and in Toronto, Canada, where he married Ethel Margaret (Esmé) Gooderham of the prominent Gooderham family. Fairfax died in Toronto in 1950.

Despite his distinguished service, there is no evidence of a personal or political relationship with Winston Churchill beyond a single signed letter from Churchill to Fairfax dated 6 December 1946. No other correspondence or meeting between the two men is documented in Churchill’s extensive published archives or biographies. The letter, which predates the publication of Churchill’s war memoirs, was later affixed inside Volume I of the six-volume Cassell first edition set of "The Second World War"—likely by Fairfax himself or a family member as a keepsake.

## Fairfax's Heroic Action at the Battle of the Somme

### Background
The 153e Régiment d’Infanterie (RI), part of the French Army’s renowned 39th Division d’Infanterie (the Steel Division), had already seen heavy combat before the Somme offensive, including at Verdun. On July 1, 1916, the opening day of the Battle of the Somme, the French and British army fronts met at this sector. That morning, as the offensive commenced, Lieutenant Colonel Bryan Fairfax, commanding the 17th Battalion King’s Liverpool Regiment, and Commandant Lepetit of the 3rd Battalion 153e RI advanced arm in arm across no man’s land in the second wave—an act symbolizing the friendship and cooperation between the two armies.

Both units succeeded in gaining their objectives. The 153e RI, under intense artillery fire, swept over five lines of enemy trenches, capturing prisoners and weaponry. Their actions earned the regiment a citation, and by war’s end, the 153e RI would be awarded the Croix de Guerre, the Croix de la Légion d’honneur, and six army-level citations, allowing its soldiers to wear the red fourragère of the légion d’honneur. Fairfax’s leadership and the joint advance stand as a testament to Allied courage and solidarity on the Somme’s bloody fields.

### Churchill’s Whereabouts During the Somme Offensive
At the time of the Battle of the Somme (July 1, 1916), Winston Churchill was serving as a battalion commander on the Western Front. After resigning from the government following the Dardanelles campaign, Churchill joined the British Army and commanded the 6th Battalion, Royal Scots Fusiliers, from January to May 1916. 

## Location of the Somme Memorial Featuring Fairfax

The memorial marking the joint advance of Colonel Bryan Fairfax and Commandant Lepetit is located at the historic front line where the British and French armies met on July 1, 1916, near Maricourt, France.

## Where was Churchill During the Somme?

All the surviving evidence—Churchill’s own correspondence, his appointment diaries, and the parliamentary record—places him in London throughout 1–3 July 1916. During this period, he was living with his brother Jack and sister-in-law “Goonie” at 41 Cromwell Road, South Kensington. On Monday 3 July, he took his seat (quietly) in the House of Commons when Parliament resumed after the weekend.

## Chartwell, Westerham, Kent: Churchill’s Country Home

Chartwell, located near Westerham in Kent, was the beloved country home of Sir Winston Churchill from 1922 until shortly before his death in 1965. The estate served as both a family retreat and a vital workspace, where Churchill wrote, painted, and entertained guests. The property’s panoramic views over the Weald of Kent were a source of inspiration for Churchill, who famously said, “A day away from Chartwell is a day wasted.”

</div>

During his years at Chartwell, Churchill used the house’s library and study as his primary workspaces. It was here that he drafted much of his correspondence and many of his major works, including his war memoirs. The library, in particular, was the intellectual heart of Chartwell, lined with books and personal papers, while the bedrooms offered privacy for personal reflection and letter writing. Although the precise room where Churchill signed the letter to Colonel Fairfax on 6 December 1946 is not documented, it is highly likely it was written in either his study or the library, both of which remain preserved today.

In December 1946, Churchill was deeply engaged in writing and political commentary, having recently delivered the “Iron Curtain” speech and begun work on "The Second World War." He was also extending his landholdings at Chartwell, acquiring additional farmland in 1946–47. No major public event is recorded at Chartwell on 6 December 1946, but Churchill’s routine at the time would have included extensive correspondence and literary work at his country home.

## Provenance

The provenance of this set is notable: it was discovered among assets held by the Canadian Federal Government as a facility on the West Coast, possibly as an unclaimed or escheated property. The lack of aging and creasing of the covers is a testament to its' vault stored location.
