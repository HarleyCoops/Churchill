# The Fairfax-Churchill Connection: Selling the Story of Colonel Bryan Fairfax

## The Legacy of Colonel Bryan Charles Fairfax, C.M.G.

Colonel Bryan Charles Fairfax, C.M.G. (1873–1956), was a distinguished figure whose life bridged the worlds of British aristocracy, Canadian military service, and the social elite of Toronto. As a direct descendant of the Barons Fairfax of Cameron, his family’s legacy stretched from the Scottish peerage to the heart of colonial America and, ultimately, to Canada.

### A Life of Service and Distinction

Fairfax’s military career began in the British Army, where he served as Captain in the King’s Own Yorkshire Light Infantry and the West India Regiment. His sense of duty led him to Canada, where he commanded the 199th Battalion (Duchess of Connaught’s Own Irish Canadian Rangers), C.E.F., during World War I. For his leadership and service, he was awarded the Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (C.M.G.).

### Canadian Roots and Social Prominence

Settling in Toronto, Fairfax married Ethel Margaret Gooderham, uniting two prominent families. The Gooderhams were renowned for their role in founding Gooderham & Worts, a cornerstone of Canadian industry. Fairfax’s home became a hub for Toronto’s social and military circles, and his legacy continued through his son, Thomas Bryan McKell Fairfax, who became the 14th Lord Fairfax of Cameron.

### The Churchill Connection

The artifact—a first edition of Winston S. Churchill’s "The Second World War: The Gathering Storm" with a personal note from Churchill to Fairfax—serves as a tangible link between two men shaped by war and leadership. Churchill’s note, dated December 1946, thanks Fairfax for a "kind letter," hinting at a correspondence between two veterans who understood the burdens of command and the complexities of a world in transition.

While the original letter from Fairfax to Churchill remains elusive, the context suggests a gesture of respect, camaraderie, or shared reflection on the challenges of their times. Churchill’s reply, preserved with the book, is a testament to the esteem in which Fairfax was held.

### Provenance and Historical Value

After Colonel Fairfax’s death in Toronto, the book and note likely remained with his family or estate, eventually entering public hands. Its sale by a Canadian governmental body underscores its authentic connection to Fairfax and, by extension, to the intertwined histories of Britain, Canada, and the United States.

### Why This Story Matters

The Fairfax-Churchill artifact is more than a collectible—it is a piece of living history. It embodies the journey of a family whose influence spanned continents and centuries, and whose members played roles in shaping the modern world. For collectors, historians, or institutions, acquiring this item means preserving a story of leadership, legacy, and the enduring bonds of the Commonwealth.

Based on the images provided and further research, here's an exploration into the background of Colonel Bryan Fairfax, C.M.G., his potential reasons for writing to Winston Churchill, and the context of the items:

The Artifact:
The item in question is a first edition Cassell printing of Winston S. Churchill's "THE SECOND WORLD WAR VOLUME 1 The Gathering Storm" (published 1948, as seen in input_file_3.jpeg and input_file_4.jpeg). Affixed to this book is a personalized note from Winston Churchill, dated 6 December 1946, addressed to "Dear Captain Fairfax" and thanking him for a "kind letter." The note indicates "Colonel Bryan Fairfax, C.M.G." as the recipient at the bottom (input_file_1.jpeg).

1. Background of Colonel Bryan Fairfax, C.M.G.

The most likely individual is Colonel Bryan Charles Fairfax, C.M.G. (1873 – 30 January 1956).

Lineage: He was the son of Thomas Ferdinand Fairfax and a descendant of the Barons Fairfax of Cameron, a Scottish peerage with historic ties to America. His son, Thomas Bryan McKell Fairfax (1923-1963), eventually became the 14th Lord Fairfax of Cameron.

Military Service:

He initially served in the British Army, achieving the rank of Captain in the 3rd Battalion, King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry, and later Captain in the West India Regiment. This aligns with Churchill addressing him as "Captain Fairfax," potentially an earlier rank by which Churchill knew or remembered him.

During World War I, he served with the Canadian Expeditionary Force (C.E.F.). He rose to the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel and commanded the 199th Battalion (Duchess of Connaught's Own Irish Canadian Rangers), C.E.F., which was recruited in Toronto. He was also associated with the 170th Battalion (Toronto Overseas).

He was awarded the Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (C.M.G.) in 1916 for his services during the war.

Canadian Connection:

His command of Canadian battalions during WWI is a primary link.

He married Ethel Margaret (Esmé) Gooderham (1882-1971), daughter of Charles Horace Gooderham of the prominent Gooderham family of Toronto (co-founders of the Gooderham & Worts distillery).

Colonel Fairfax resided in Toronto, Canada, for many years, with listed addresses including "Playter's Hill" and later 28 Drumsnab Road in Rosedale. He died in Toronto in 1956.

Significance of Rank Discrepancy: Churchill addressing him as "Dear Captain Fairfax" while the typed addressee is "Colonel Bryan Fairfax, C.M.G." is likely due to Churchill using an older, perhaps more familiar rank. By 1946, Fairfax was indeed a Colonel, but Churchill might have known him earlier in his career as Captain.

2. Why Fairfax May Have Written to Churchill (leading to the thank-you note of Dec 1946):

Churchill's note thanks Fairfax for his "kind letter." Without Fairfax's original letter, the precise reason is speculative, but several possibilities arise given the context of December 1946:

Churchill's Activities: Churchill was Leader of the Opposition in the UK Parliament. He had delivered his famous "Iron Curtain" speech in Fulton, Missouri, in March 1946 and was actively involved in political discourse. He was also beginning the extensive work on his war memoirs, "The Second World War."

Possible Reasons for Fairfax's Letter:

General Support or Admiration: Fairfax, a retired Colonel with WWI command experience and a resident of a key Commonwealth nation (Canada), might have written to express support or admiration for Churchill's past leadership or his ongoing political efforts.

Comments on Speeches/Current Events: He might have been moved to write by one of Churchill's recent speeches or his stance on pressing post-war issues (the emerging Cold War, the future of Europe, etc.).

Offering Personal Reflections: While Fairfax's primary combat command was in WWI, he would have been an astute observer of WWII and the inter-war period. He might have offered some reflections, though it's less likely he was providing direct material for WWII memoirs unless he had specific insights into the lead-up or broader strategic matters.

Personal Connection/Seasonal Greetings: It's possible there was a more personal, less formal connection, or simply that Fairfax sent seasonal greetings, prompting the "kind letter" acknowledgment. Given his societal standing in Canada and military background, corresponding with a figure like Churchill would not be unusual.

The timing (December 1946) places the correspondence about 1.5 years before the publication of "The Gathering Storm" (mid-1948). The note being affixed to this particular volume suggests that Fairfax (or a subsequent owner) associated Churchill's personal acknowledgement with his monumental work on the Second World War.

3. Has Fairfax's Original Letter to Churchill Been Kept?

Churchill's vast archive of personal and political papers is primarily held at the Churchill Archives Centre, Churchill College, Cambridge, UK.

To determine if Fairfax's letter was preserved, one would need to search the Archives Centre's catalogues (e.g., the CALM online catalogue) for correspondence from Colonel Bryan Fairfax (or Captain Fairfax) received by Winston Churchill around November-December 1946.

Letters deemed of significant historical importance or from notable individuals were usually kept. However, more routine correspondence might not have been retained or catalogued individually. Without a direct search of the archives, this cannot be definitively confirmed.

4. "Life-long connection between Fairfax and Churchill"

There is no immediate evidence of a deep, continuous "life-long connection" in the sense of close personal friendship or continuous collaboration.

They were contemporaries (Churchill b. 1874, Fairfax b. 1873).

Both had significant military careers, though largely in different spheres and at different levels of command/political influence at various times. Churchill was First Lord of the Admiralty and later Minister of Munitions and Secretary of State for War and Air during periods of Fairfax's WWI service.

It's more likely they were known to each other as figures within the British and Commonwealth military and establishment circles. The 1946 letter exchange is one documented point of contact.

A "life-long connection" may be an overstatement unless further specific correspondence or records of interaction across their lives emerge.

5. Tracing the Fairfax Family to Canada and Artifact Provenance

Family in Canada: As established, Colonel Bryan Charles Fairfax had very strong ties to Canada through his WWI service commanding Canadian troops, his marriage into the Canadian Gooderham family, his long-term residency in Toronto, and his death and burial there. His son, who inherited the Fairfax peerage, was also associated with Canada.


In Summary:

Colonel Bryan Charles Fairfax, C.M.G., was a distinguished military officer with strong Canadian ties, including command of Canadian forces in WWI and a life lived largely in Toronto. In late 1946, he likely wrote a letter to Winston Churchill – perhaps offering encouragement, reflections, or comments on contemporary events – which Churchill acknowledged with the thank-you note now affixed to the first volume of Churchill's war memoirs. The provenance of the book and note, purportedly sold by a Canadian governmental body, further cements its connection to Colonel Fairfax of Toronto. The existence of Fairfax's original letter to Churchill would require investigation at the Churchill Archives Centre.
